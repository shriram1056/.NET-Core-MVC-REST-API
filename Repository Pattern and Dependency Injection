REPOSITORY PATTERN AND DEPENDENCY INJECTION (DI): Birds of a feather flock together

MY DEFINITION

remove data access code inside the ActionResults

Repository is a interface that has the list of methods exposed to hide their implementation like we have a blueprint of return type, parameter and uses but don't know how its done.

This is not wasteful, in some cases, because we can change the implementation(ORM or database) methods and easily switch one with the other if we want to using dependecy injection

even switch between mock data implementation and ORM inside ActionResults
