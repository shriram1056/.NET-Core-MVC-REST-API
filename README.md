# CLI Commands REST API (ASP.NET Core MVC)

**a REST API made to help me remember the gazillion terminal commands (C#, ASP.NET Core, MVC, SQL Server, REST API). This Commands API stores command line snippets along with a short description of what it does, as well as which platform it's for.**

### The purpose of this project is to learn and practice concepts related to:<br />
> * Building a REST API
> * .NET Core
> * MVC Architectural Pattern
> * C#

#### More specifically, I used the following:
> * Dependency injection
> * Repository design pattern
> * SQL Server Express & SSMS
> * Entity Framework Core O/RM (DBContext, Migration)
> * Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) & AutoMapper
> * RESTful API guidelines
> * HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
> * Views (Razor, Shared Layout, ViewBag, RenderSection)
> * Testing API Endpoints (SwaggerUI & Postman)
> * Docker (Container, Image, Deploying on Docker Hub)
> * Microsoft Azure (Deployment: Docker Image + SQL Database))

_Note: Please excuse the large amount of comments in my code, they are used as notes for later review._
